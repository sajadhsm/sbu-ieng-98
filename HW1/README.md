The app is up and running on heroku: [https://sbu-ieng-98-hw1.herokuapp.com/](https://sbu-ieng-98-hw1.herokuapp.com/)

Method | Path | Query | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
**GET** | `/gis/testpoint` | `?lat&long` | Return list of polygons which contains the point

```
Result:
```
{
    "polygons": [
        "Tehran"
    ]
}
```

## Load Testing
A simple load test was made using [Artillery](https://artillery.io).

It created 100 "virtual users" each of which sent 100 HTTP GET requests to `/gis/testpoint`.
